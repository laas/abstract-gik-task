\brief Description of a constraint that limits the position of a point of the robot to a given plan.
 
The constraint is defined by the following equation:
   \f{eqnarray*} \left(\vec{MT} | \vec{u}\right) = 0 \f}
   where 
   \li \f$ M\f$ is a point attached to the joint (specified in the joint's local frame).
   \li \f$ T\f$ is a point in the environment,
   \li \f$\vec{u}\f$ is a vector defining the normal to the task plane.
